Data immersion course ALURA LATAM. <br>
This is my first enclousing to DataScience, I'm very grateful to Alura LATAM to let me participate in this course. It was very helpful and challenging.
This is my path now. I hope learning new skills every day to encourage myself and be prepared to the new developing technologies.
I'm training everyday to get better at programming language, indeed I learned some skills on Python, there is a lot more to learn
I have another courses, and one of them is again with Alura. Bet at the end of the course i can get rid of very diffcult problems (at least for me at this moment).
